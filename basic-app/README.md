# REACT

**Component**

- components in React are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can have their own structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

## Class components vs Functional components.

React offers two main types of components: class components and functional components. Both serve the same purposeâ€”to render UIâ€”but they differ in how they are written and the features they support.

#### Functional Components key features
- **Simple Syntax**: They are just functions that accept props and return JSX.
- **Hooks:** With the addition of hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects, previously only possible with class components.
- **Performance**: Functional components are often lighter and can have better performance.

#### Class Components key features
- **State Management**: Class components have built-in state management using this.state.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Class components use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount for managing side effects.
- **More Verbose**: Class components can be more complex and verbose compared to functional components.

## ðŸ“œ JSX Expressions 

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is commonly used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to visualize the UI structure of your components. JSX is fundamental to writing React applications.
