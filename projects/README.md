# React Project - Small Components

This project contains small React components, each demonstrating a specific functionality. Below is a brief synopsis of each component included:

## 1. Counter
A simple counter component where users can increment, decrement, or reset a number.
- **Features:** Increase, decrease, and reset the counter value.
- **Use Case:** Learning state management with `useState`.

## 2. Todo
A basic to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Features:** Add, remove, and toggle the status of tasks.
- **Use Case:** Managing an array of tasks and handling dynamic input with React.

## 3. Meal API
A component that fetches and displays meal recipes from an external API (e.g., TheMealDB API). Users can search for meals by name or category.
- **Features:** API calls with `fetch` or `axios`, displaying fetched data in a list.
- **Use Case:** Working with side effects (`useEffect`) and API integration.

## 4. Calculator
A simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Features:** Input handling, operation logic, and displaying results.
- **Use Case:** Implementing complex logic and managing multiple states.

## 5. Toggle Color
A component that changes the background color of the page or a specific element when a button is clicked.
- **Features:** Toggling between different color schemes (e.g., light/dark mode).
- **Use Case:** Handling conditional rendering and state toggling.

## 6. Hidden Search
A search input that is initially hidden and only becomes visible when an icon or button is clicked.
- **Features:** Expanding/collapsing a search bar on click.
- **Use Case:** Managing element visibility with state and adding simple animations.

## 7. Testimonials
A carousel or slider component that displays user testimonials one at a time with navigation buttons.
- **Features:** Cycling through testimonials with next/prev buttons or auto-scroll.
- **Use Case:** Working with timed intervals (`setInterval`) and dynamic content.

## 8. Accordions
A collapsible list where clicking on a section header expands its content while collapsing others.
- **Features:** Expanding/collapsing content panels based on user interaction.
- **Use Case:** Managing active states and handling list data with React.

## 9. Basic Form Validation
A form component that validates inputs like email, password, etc., and provides feedback when inputs are invalid.
- **Features:** Real-time validation and error messages.
- **Use Case:** Handling form input, validation logic, and feedback states.

## 10. E-Commerce Advanced Filtering
A filtering component for e-commerce products, allowing users to filter by categories, price range, ratings, etc.
- **Features:** Multi-filter logic and real-time updates to the product list.
- **Use Case:** Managing complex state (filter combinations) and optimizing performance when handling large datasets.

Each of these components focuses on key React concepts such as state management, event handling, side effects, and conditional rendering. They are designed to help you practice essential skills in small, focused projects.
